# Election_Analysis 
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 
To determine the results, we were to: 
1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 
## Resources
-	Data Source: election_results.csv
-	Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1
## Summary 
The analysis of the election show that: 
-	There were “369,711” votes cast in the election. 
-	The candidates were: 
o	Charles Casper Stockham
o	Diana DeGette
o	Raymon Anthony Doane
-	The candidate results were: 
o	Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the votes and 85,213 number of votes
o	Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes
o	Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes and 11,606 number of votes
-	The winner of the election was 
o	Diana DeGette, who received 738% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes.
## Challenge Overview
-	For the challenge I was to use the data from the election_results.csv to find out who won the election. To determine who won the election I used the total percentage and total number of votes that were cast for each candidate. The candidate that received the highest number of votes along with the biggest percentage of votes was deemed the winner of the election. 
## Challenge Summary
-	I used Visual Studio Code and Python to complete the analysis of the data. The results were printed to a document named election_analysis as follows:
